# Simple Gamepad library

A simple library to connect and read inputs from gamepads, like the PS4
or the XBox controllers. For the time being, this library just provides
a convenient C++ interface. It uses another library to actually read the
inputs from the gamepad.

To make this work, the libstem\_gamepad library is required.
